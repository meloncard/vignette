# Vignette

Vignette makes it dead simple to run reliable A/b tests in your Rails project.

Repo at https://www.github.com/hayesgm/vignette

## Examples

Vignette is as simple as sampling from an Array:

    @price = [5, 10, 15].vignette

We've also added a filter to HAML for running quick A/b tests:

    %h1
      :vignette
        Welcome to the Zoo.
        Come to see the Lions!
        Don't get caught by a lemur!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'vignette'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vignette

## Usage

Vignette was crafted to make A/b testing as simple as possible.  Simply run the `vignette` function on any Array and get the result from a A/b test.  Vignette will store this choice in session, a cookies or nowhere, based on how you configure Vignette.  If you're in the request cycle (within an around_filter), Vignette will grab `session` or `cookies` for you.  Otherwise, you'll need to specify where to store the result (if you want it consistent for the end-user).  Vignette `tests` are identified by a checksum of the Array, and thus, changing the Array results in a new `test`.
  
    # To store in session (default)
    Vignette.init(store: :session)

    # To use cookies
    Vignette.init(store: :cookies)

    # Or random sampling [no persistence]
    Vignette.init(store: :random)

    # Other options
    Vignette.init(logging: true) # add debug logging

Running tests:

    [ 1,2,3 ].vignette # Chooses an option and stores test as indicated above
    %w{one two three}.vignette # Same with strings

    # or in HAML

    :vignette
      Test one
      Test <strong>two</strong>
      Test #{three}

Finally, to store in analytics which tests were run, simple check

    Vignette.test -> { 'views/orders/new.html.haml:54d3c10a1b21' => 'Test one' } # First choice was select for new.html.haml test

N.B. If you choose to store your `tests` in `cookies`, then the chosen result will be stored in a cookie sent to the user's browser.  Thus, be careful not to store any secret information in a test.
